This notebook uses web scraping to parse out and list certain parts of job searches and puts them into a csv file.
When running this notebook, it'll ask for a job you want to search for and a location, then it'll scrape the web page made
by searching for those on careerbuilder.
It'll then return a csv file containing the job title, company name, and location for all the job in the search results.
